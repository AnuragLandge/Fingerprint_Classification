# Fingerprint_Classification
## Project Description
This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of forensic fingerprint analysis using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Traditional manual fingerprint matching methods are slow and prone to errors. By leveraging deep learning, the project seeks to automate and enhance fingerprint identification and classification processes, thereby assisting forensic investigators in solving criminal cases more effectively.

## Key Features
Deep Learning Models: Utilization of CNNs for fingerprint analysis.
Two Primary Tasks:
Subject category hand area segmentation
Finger number classification
Modern Techniques: Implementation of CNNs, Batch Normalizations, Dropout Layers, and Softmax Activations.
Model Evaluation: Use of confusion matrices and other metrics to evaluate model accuracy and performance.
Visualization Tool: TensorBoard integration for monitoring the training process and model interpretability.
